# [ GLYPH :: PCB ]

This folder stores Glyph's PCB and its libraries. Thanks to the [scotto-kicad](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Extras/ScottoKicad) KiCad footprint and symbol library and SnapMagic for not having an up-to-date KiCad plugin and making me manually download the joystick footprint.

There are two KiCad projects, one for each side. I've tried my best to make sure they use relative paths, but please let me know if something fails to open for you.
