Hello world! I'm working on Glyph, a fun, portable, and comfortable split keyboard. It's the logical next step after designing and fixing the Hexapad. In this session I mostly just worked on the layout and gimmick of the keyboard. The key assignment isn't done yet but I want to start on the PCB now so I'll save that for later. Glyph has a finger-staggered main matrix of 6x3, and a key and joystick for each thumb. The joystick is the main gimmick of the board - you'll use it to switch layers and navigate documents. I started designing in FigJam but realized it would be hard to match up with my hands so I moved to using my notebook instead. While the keymap isn't complete, I'd like to have a layer for symbols, specials, and metas. Symbols include the number row and misc symbols like +, - and =. Specials - accessible with the right thumb - are brackets, quotation marks, /, and other common programming symbols. Meta keys are keys that adjust the keyboard, like RGB.

## [ MAY 29: BASICS ]

Hey again! Today I'm going to be working on the basic skeleton of the left half of the keyboard. In my spare time I've been trying to find a suitable joystick - first googling around for one I found on Adafruit ([this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/512)), then realizing SnapMagic exists and searching there. I eventually settled on the [COM-09032](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/COM-09032/SparkFun%20Electronics/view-part/). I then spent a LONG time trying to figure out how to get the symbol and footprint into KiCad from SnapMagic. After trying a bunch of different things (turns out there IS a kicad plugin but it's for an ancient version) I figured out how to import a footprint and started on design.

For glyph I'm going to be using a Raspberry Pi Pico - I have a bunch of them and they have plenty of I/O and are easy to work with. After spending a fair bit finding a reference for the matrix (ended up taking a screenshot of the Hexapad's matrix and using that) I got to work popping the switches down!

This was mostly just copying and pasting. Then I researched how to use a joystick with Pico, and after tracking down a broken link on SparkFun's product page, arrived at this wiring:

_(side note: the sparkfun product page included [an explanation of how the joystick worked](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/thumb-joystick-hookup-guide/how-does-an-analog-thumb-joystick-work), which i found super neat)_

And to finish today off, I quickly added the thumb button:

Tomorrow (which is friday :yay:) I'll add the RGB and start on the PCB design - hopefully I can knock out the entire PCB this weekend and only need to finish the case and firmware!

## [ MAY 31 // GLOW ]

_note: I forgot to save while writing this so I'm rewriting this entry from memory on Jun 2_

Hai :3! Today I'll add the RGB and start on the case design. I started researching different NeoPixel-style LEDs - I wanted something small but still reasonably hand-solderable. Instead of doing perkey RGB, which takes a lot of resources and a lot of soldering, I'm going to do something like an "underglow" with 6 RGB LEDs on each side. However, the Adafruit docs say you need a 0.1uF capacitor for each neopixel, which was pretty annoying for the Hexapad. But the docs also say in some cases you can do 1 cap to 2 LEDs, knocking it down to 3 caps per side, which I'm comfortable with. I googled around ([these ones](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2758) were pretty common but looked hard to solder), and eventually found [these](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4960) NeoPixels with nice, long legs that should be good for hand-soldering. Turns out these are actually the reverse-mount LEDs people were using for their hackpads! After debugging a weird KiCad crash (and it magically working again ðŸ™„) I imported the ScottoKeebs library and had a slight struggle wiring up the neopixels with 1 cap per pair. Some digging made why the cap was needed "click" and I found that I was doing it all wrong. Here's the final, corrected wiring I ended up with:

To finish off today I assigned all the footprints (using hotswaps for the switches) and moved to the PCB editor.
