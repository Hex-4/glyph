Hello world! I'm working on Glyph, a fun, portable, and comfortable split keyboard. It's the logical next step after designing and fixing the Hexapad. In this session I mostly just worked on the layout and gimmick of the keyboard. The key assignment isn't done yet but I want to start on the PCB now so I'll save that for later. Glyph has a finger-staggered main matrix of 6x3, and a key and joystick for each thumb. The joystick is the main gimmick of the board - you'll use it to switch layers and navigate documents. I started designing in FigJam but realized it would be hard to match up with my hands so I moved to using my notebook instead. While the keymap isn't complete, I'd like to have a layer for symbols, specials, and metas. Symbols include the number row and misc symbols like +, - and =. Specials - accessible with the right thumb - are brackets, quotation marks, /, and other common programming symbols. Meta keys are keys that adjust the keyboard, like RGB.

## [ MAY 29: BASICS ]

Hey again! Today I'm going to be working on the basic skeleton of the left half of the keyboard. In my spare time I've been trying to find a suitable joystick - first googling around for one I found on Adafruit ([this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/512)), then realizing SnapMagic exists and searching there. I eventually settled on the [COM-09032](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/COM-09032/SparkFun%20Electronics/view-part/). I then spent a LONG time trying to figure out how to get the symbol and footprint into KiCad from SnapMagic. After trying a bunch of different things (turns out there IS a kicad plugin but it's for an ancient version) I figured out how to import a footprint and started on design.

For glyph I'm going to be using a Raspberry Pi Pico - I have a bunch of them and they have plenty of I/O and are easy to work with. After spending a fair bit finding a reference for the matrix (ended up taking a screenshot of the Hexapad's matrix and using that) I got to work popping the switches down!

This was mostly just copying and pasting. Then I researched how to use a joystick with Pico, and after tracking down a broken link on SparkFun's product page, arrived at this wiring:

_(side note: the sparkfun product page included [an explanation of how the joystick worked](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/thumb-joystick-hookup-guide/how-does-an-analog-thumb-joystick-work), which i found super neat)_

And to finish today off, I quickly added the thumb button:

Tomorrow (which is friday :yay:) I'll add the RGB and start on the PCB design - hopefully I can knock out the entire PCB this weekend and only need to finish the case and firmware!

## [ MAY 31 // GLOW ]

_[note: I forgot to save while writing this so I'm rewriting this entry from memory on Jun 2]_

Hai :3! Today I'll add the RGB and start on the case design. I started researching different NeoPixel-style LEDs - I wanted something small but still reasonably hand-solderable. Instead of doing perkey RGB, which takes a lot of resources and a lot of soldering, I'm going to do something like an "underglow" with 6 RGB LEDs on each side. However, the Adafruit docs say you need a 0.1uF capacitor for each neopixel, which was pretty annoying for the Hexapad. But the docs also say in some cases you can do 1 cap to 2 LEDs, knocking it down to 3 caps per side, which I'm comfortable with. I googled around ([these ones](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2758) were pretty common but looked hard to solder), and eventually found [these](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4960) NeoPixels with nice, long legs that should be good for hand-soldering. Turns out these are actually the reverse-mount LEDs people were using for their hackpads! After debugging a weird KiCad crash (and it magically working again ðŸ™„) I imported the ScottoKeebs library and had a slight struggle wiring up the neopixels with 1 cap per pair. Some digging made why the cap was needed "click" and I found that I was doing it all wrong. Here's the final, corrected wiring I ended up with:

To finish off today I assigned all the footprints (using hotswaps for the switches) and moved to the PCB editor.

## [ JUN 4 // ARRANGEMENTS ]

_[ done in the Highway Roadtrip call! ]_

I was just about to start laying out the PCB, when I realized... the PCB needs a way to talk to the other half of the keyboard. After some googling around I came across a Reddit thread suggesting UART, which doesn't need pullup resistors. Nice! This also fits perfectly with a TRRS jack (power, tx, rx, and gnd), so I used the ScottoKeebs TRRS symbol.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc98ec0-6ab6-4993-9a33-705b93becb5e)

I put it in to the Kicad PCB editor and struggled to setup the grid properly so I could lay out the keyswitches. After (eventually) fixing the snapping settings to make it work I started laying down the switches:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4386d854-1c2b-44bf-94e6-5f3575548d47)


... and promptly realized I wasn't doing them in the correct order. Quickly fixing them (it was actually quite relaxing), here it is:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ebe14c-8a90-415d-9319-d805d605a58c)

I then added the diodes (KiCad crashed while doing this! Scary! But luckily it autosaved my work and I didn't lose much), and arranged the other parts. The RGB is in three corners and I found a lovely spot for the Pico and TRRS jack.

That's all for today! Tomorrow I'll route the whole thing (!!), print it out to test for fit, and get to work on the right side.

## [ JUN 9 // ROUTING ]

Hello!

I booted up Kicad and started getting ready for routing. First, I noticed that the hotswap sockets... were on the back of the PCB? That didn't look right. But after some googling I found that these actually _were_ supposed to go on the back of the board. As well during my research, I found that millmax 0305s were a pretty popular hotswap option, but ended up deciding against them because it would mean a lot more soldering. Flipping all the components to the sides they were supposed to be on, I assigned 3D models to some of the parts:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf09a51-1cdb-4a97-b598-17eb52382bb5)

On to routing! This time for Glyph I'm going to manually route everything because when I used an autorouter for the Hexapad it produced some... interesting results. Some searching around on Reddit produced [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/fxupwp/need_help_with_pcb_design/) which suggested some track widths I'm comfortable with. I'm also going to try a ground pour with Glyph, which should make routing a little less painful.

I also edited some footprints to make them easier to solder:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc846092-306c-4b48-bada-08bbe5d6c4bb)

When I started routing I realized I still needed to print out the PCB to check for fit. But my printer was out of ink, so I did what any normal person would do, and taped a piece of paper to my screen and traced out all the keys.

After painstakingly replicating my layout, I checked it against my hand and it was pretty comfy! So I switched back to routing.

There isn't really much to say about this other than that it was very relaxing.

Chonky 3v3 lines for the LEDs:

With only a few routes left, I ran DRC and got this strange hole clearance error. The ScottoKeebs footprint put a NPTH REALLY close to the pin hole. Weird. I spent a lot of time trying a lot of different things and ended up removing the board-wide clearance for copper-to-hole. The netclass still has a 0.2mm clearance and this allows the footprint's clearance override (which I'm assuming is to fix this problem) to take effect.

There were a few more DRC track clearance errors, so I fixed those up. Some clearance-fixing and routing later, Glyph[Left] v0 is done! Apart from the PCB art and outline, of course.
