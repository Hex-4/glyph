Hello world! I'm working on Glyph, a fun, portable, and comfortable split keybooard. It's the logical next step after designing and fixing the Hexapad. In this session I mostly just worked on the layout and gimmick of the keyboard. The key assignment isn't done yet but I want to start on the PCB now so I'll save that for later. Glyph has a finger-staggered main matrix of 6x3, and a key and joystick for each thumb. The joystick is the main gimmick of the board - you'll use it to switch layers and navigate documents. I started designing in FigJam but realized it would be hard to match up with my hands so I moved to using my notebook instead. While the keymap isn't complete, I'd like to have a layer for symbols, specials, and metas. Symbols include the number row and misc symbols like +, - and =. Specials - accessible with the right thumb - are brackets, quotation marks, /, and other common programming symbols. Meta keys are keys that adjust the keyboard, like RGB.
