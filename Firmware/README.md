# [ GLYPH :: FIRMWARE ]

This folder stores [glyph]'s [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware) firmware! To use it, first flash both Picos with CircuitPython. Then, [rename](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/renaming-circuitpy) each drive to `GLYPH_L` and `GLYPH_R`. To finish up, just copy over the contents of each folder here to their respective drives.
